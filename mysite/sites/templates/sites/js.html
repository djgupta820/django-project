                <p> 
                    JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is 
                    a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript 
                    specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time 
                    compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, 
                    dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and 
                    first-class functions.Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is 
                    one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. 
                    Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,
                    often incorporating third-party libraries. 
                    All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine 
                    to execute the code on the user's device.
                </p>
                <p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, 
                    functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application 
                    programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, 
                    regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document 
                    Object Model (DOM).

                <h3> Website client-side usage </h3>
                <p> 
                    JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of 
                    the Web, with 97% of websites using it for this purpose. 
                    Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents 
                    and interact with the DOM. All major web browsers have a 
                    built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the 
                    user's device.

                <h3> Libraries and frameworks </h3>
                <p> 
                    Over 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or 
                    web framework for their client-side scripting. jQuery is by 
                    far the most popular library, used by over 75% of websites. 
                    Facebook created the React library for its website and 
                    later released it as open source; other sites, including 
                    Twitter, now use it.
                </p>
                <p> Likewise, the Angular framework created by Google for its 
                    websites, including YouTube and Gmail, is now an open source 
                    project used by others. In contrast, the term "Vanilla JS" has 
                    been coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks, 
                    instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.
